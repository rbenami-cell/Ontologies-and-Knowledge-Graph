Semantic Ontologies for AI-Driven Network Operations

This repository hosts a collection of ontology models and knowledge-graph artifacts used to represent **intent-based, AI-driven, and closed-loop network operations**. Each ontology is authored in Turtle (.ttl) format and designed for use with knowledge-graph platforms and digital-twin frameworks.

Purpose

Modern communication networks produce enormous amounts of events, metrics, and topology data.  
To enable autonomous, intent-based operations, these must be represented semantically — linking **resources**, **services**, **policies**, and intents in a unified knowledge model.  

This repository provides that foundation through reusable ontologies for:
- Network modeling across IP, optical, and RAN layers  
- Intent and policy representation for closed-loop assurance  
- Digital-twin synchronization between operational and simulated states  
- AI-agent reasoning on service quality, fault, and performance

Repository Structure

| Folder/File | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| alarm-ontology.ttl` | Capture a sample classes and properties for alarm physical link and measurement). |
| Cross Domain Interaction Ontology.ttl | Captures a sample of O-RAN cross domain interaction). |
| Device Ontology.ttl | Capture a sample of device interface, port for O-RAN functions such as O-CU and O-DU . |
| ............ |

Standards Alignment
