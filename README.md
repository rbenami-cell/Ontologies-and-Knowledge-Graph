**Semantic Ontologies for AI-Driven Network Operations**

This repository hosts a collection of ontology models and knowledge-graph artifacts used to represent **intent-based, AI-driven, and closed-loop network operations**. Each ontology is authored in **Turtle (.ttl)** format and designed for use with knowledge-graph platforms and digital-twin frameworks.

Purpose

Modern communication networks produce enormous amounts of events, metrics, and topology data.  
To enable autonomous, intent-based operations, these must be represented semantically — linking **resources**, **services**, **policies**, and intents in a unified knowledge model.  

This repository provides that foundation through reusable ontologies for:
- Network modeling across IP, optical, and RAN layers  
- Intent and policy representation** for closed-loop assurance  
- Digital-twin synchronization** between operational and simulated states  
- AI-agent reasoning** on service quality, fault, and performance

Repository Structure

| Folder/File | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `network-layer.ttl` | Defines classes and properties for logical and physical network elements (nodes, links, layers). |
| `intent-model.ttl` | Captures the intent lifecycle (expression → negotiation → monitoring → remediation). |
| `assurance-model.ttl` | Models assurance agents, closed-loop events, and TMF-aligned KPIs. |
| `digital-twin.ttl` | Describes digital-twin entities and synchronization with real network state. |
| `common/vocabulary.ttl` | Canonical classes and properties shared across models (aligned with TMF SID/eTOM). |

Standards Alignment

These ontologies are aligned with key standards:
TM Forum ODA / SID / eTOM
ETSI ZSM (Zero-Touch Service Management)
ITU-T Y.4500.12 / M.3080 (Digital-Twin Frameworks)
IETF RFC 8345 / 9375 (Network topology and model composition)
GSMA CAMARA / Open Gateway APIs for exposure

Usage

You can load and explore these models using:
[Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) — for ontology editing and visualization  
[Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/) — for querying via SPARQL  
[GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) — for reasoning and data federation  

Example SPARQL query:
```sparql
PREFIX net: <http://example.org/network#>
SELECT ?node ?layer
WHERE {
  ?node a net:NetworkNode .
  ?node net:belongsToLayer ?layer .
}
